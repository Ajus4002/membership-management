# Membership Management System - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

A complete backend system for membership management with two main components:
- **Admin Web App** (`/app` routes) - For administrators to manage members, events, and view analytics
- **Mobile App** (`/api` routes) - For members to access their accounts, renew memberships, and register for events

- npm or yarn

### Quick Start
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
